\section{Introduction } 
Chemical sensors are miniaturised devices that can deliver real time and on-line information on the presence of specific compounds or ions in even complex samples \cite{cammann1996cambridge}. 
 Among them, optical chemical sensors employ optical transduction techniques to yield analyte information \cite{mcdonagh_optical_2008}. Due to the outstanding characteristics of both fluorescence and phosphorescence signals, they are widely applied to the construction of chemical sensors where susceptible fluorescence molecules are immobilized on a surface \cite{wolfbeis_materials_2005}.This kind of sensors has been used in many different applications in biology, medicine, environment,  \completar{.... Completar aplicaciones y referencias}. 
 
 Recently fluorescence chemo-sensors has been also proposed as useful tool in particle and nuclear physics, in particular, to establish that neutrinos are their own antiparticles \cite{majorana_teoria_2008}. \completar{aqui tal vez mencionar algo de la colaboración NEXT... esto para Juanjo} It has been proposed that the way to demonstrate this effect is by detecting the \Ba daughter produced in the decay of Xe atoms \cite{Nygren_2015} because only the double beta decay of the $^{136}$Xe isotope is expected to produce \Ba ions within a radiopure particle detector.
 Initially, the use of a common indicator, Fluo3, was proposed as chemo-sensor for the trapping of the \Ba ions,\cite{jones_single_2016},\cite{next_collaboration_demonstration_2018} and, nowadays, works have evolved to the design and synthesis of new functional molecules that could serve as sensors for the single ion sensing \cite{thapa_barium_2019},  \cite{thapa_demonstration_2021}. The concept includes the functionalization of a surface detector with the fluorescence molecular detector, which, by interaction with the \Ba change their fluorescence response, either by enhance or shift of the emitted light.  
 
 Within this context, we has been recently synthesized the molecule shown in Figure\ref{ModeloFBI}, the Fluorescent Bicolor Indicators (FBI), which has been designed to have a strong selectivity for capturing \Ba. \cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020} This molecule has a crown ether derivative groups as trapping cage for the ions bonded to a custom-designed fluorophore. Interestingly, upon chelation, not only the crown ether but the phenyl group of the nitrogen-containing fluorophore participate in the coordination bond with the \Ba  ion, which induces a large molecular torsion with respect to the free FBI molecule (see figure \ref{ModeloFBI}). As a consequence, a considerably blue-shifted emission spectrum upon forming the \Ba  complex (chelation) has been measured in solution\cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020} Moreover, the molecules embedded in silica pellets retain their fluorescence properties when they are measured in air and has the capability of capturing sublimated \Ba.

\end{figure*}  

 In the way to develop a final chemo-sensor for neutrino detection, it is necessary to immobilize the molecules on a surface while remaining its ion sensitivity, and everything in the absence of any solvent, since detector will be installed in a high-pressure gas xenon chamber. In the present work we address this task and we demonstrate that the FBI molecules, sublimated in UHV conditions onto different substrate (see scheme in Figure \ref{ModeloFBI}, remain their high capability to trap metal ions. Moreover, by combining highly surface sensitive techniques, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we prove how different ions interact differetnly with the molecules and only the \Ba ions induce the molecular structural changes that modified the electronic structure and has a final implication in the fluorescence emission. Crown ether coordination entirely happens in vacuum, which ensures that chemical, structural and electronic changes are not affected by solvents, air molecules or spurious contaminants. This is a crucial step toward the development of the Ba tagging sensor and provides the bases to envision the application of this kind of crown ether-based chemosensors in a broad development of sensing, such as the detection of Ra atoms.

Crown ethers have been important and fundamental macrocyclic molecules in applications such as drug carriers \cite{uchegbu_non-ionic_1998} or photo-switching devices \cite{malval_photoswitching_2002}, \cite{uda_membrane_2005} because of their capability to capture a variety of guest species, including metal cations, protonated species and neutral and ionic molecules \cite{dobler1980ionophores}, \cite{gokel_crown_1991} have been extensively used in solution, or even in gas phase to recognize and trap metal or molecular ions \cite{more_intrinsic_1999}, \cite{maleknia_cavity-size-dependent_2002} but, despite their unique coordinating properties, crown ethers have been poorly exploited in solid state. Few examples can be found in the literature where self-assembled monolayers of crown ether derivatives have been grown and used on surfaces, but all of them includes the growth and/or de ion trapping in solution \cite{yoshimoto_hostguest_2003}, \cite{flink_recognition_1999}, \cite{inokuchi_new_2015}. 
 There are only two works, as far as we know, where crown ether were deposited under ultra high vacuum conditions (UHV) \cite{feng_growth_2018} and their metal trapping capability were proven also under UHV \cite{stredansky_-surface_2019}. In this last work, reactivity of the crowns upon anchoring on an organic template on Au(111) is carefully explored and they probe, by combining XPS and STM, that the crown ethers, assembled into a regular 2D guest–host array, can successfully trap sodium atoms.

\subsection{Chemical probe of chelation}
Prior to address the chelation of the molecule, we start by confirming that FBI molecules are sublimated intact on the substrate. Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} shows the molecular core levels of FBI molecules, i.e. O 1s, N 1s and C 1s. The spectra were measured for 0.65 ML deposited at RT on Au(111). The ratios between the three core levels are in agreement with having stoichiometric molecules on the surface (C/O = 6.2, C/N = 10.3). The C 1s core level, which appears centered at around 285 eV, can be fitted using two components, one centered at around 284.7 eV and a second and more intense one at 286.3 eV, with relative intensities in agreement with intact molecule. The former component corresponds to C-C bonds whereas the component at higher binding energy (B.E.) includes contributions from C-O and C-N. In the N 1s region, around 400 eV, a faint peak is visible. The position of the maxima is compatible with the two amida groups of the molecular composition. Finally, the O 1s core level present a single component peak centered at 532.8 eV.

(d) O1s core level of chelated FBI molecules for different FBI thicknesses and (e) the evolution of chelated component as a function of the \Ba deposition}
\end{figure*}  

For the chelation, \BaCl was sublimated on the FBI functionalized Au(111) surface. It is worth to mention that upon sublimation, the stoichiometry of the salt does not remain 1:2 but rather 2:1. This means that mainly \Ba is deposited on the surface (see S.I. for details).
Thus, after sublimation of 1.5 \Ba per FBI molecule, Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)}, the core levels, mainly on O 1s and N 1s, show a clear shifts toward higher B.E.

The maximum O 1s core level shows an upward shift of 0.5 eV. This shift is not just a doping shift, but a real chemical change, as reveal the evolution of the O 1s for very low \Ba doses on the surface. Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} shows the O 1s evolution for \Ba ions amounts below 1 \Ba per FBI molecule. \completar{describir aquí la figura de evolución de O 1s, y hablar de que aparece una segunda componente (moleculas cheladas) frente a la componente inicial (moleculas no queladas) y que esto es una prueba de que lo que vemos es en realidad la chelación y no un spacially average doping of the surface. Mencionar que en la supp info se muestra como se ha restado el background debido a la presencia del CL del Au}. The contribution to the O 1s peak from the neighbouring Au 4p was subtracted using the spectrum of the clean Au. More information can be found in the supplementary information.

In the only reference paper were crown ether deposited on Au(111) were chelated, ref. \cite{stredansky_-surface_2019} Stredansky and coworkers observed higher shifts for the O1s core level, that gradually shifts up to around 1 eV by increasing the amount of deposited atoms (which for their case were Na atoms). 
To evaluate whether the nature of the dopant atom has any influence in the oxygen core level shift for the FBI molecules, we tested the chelation with Na. Thus, figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} shows the O 1s and N 1s core level measured on 0.6 ML of FBI on Au(111) after the sublimation of 0.3 nm of NaCl. The maximum O 1s shift for \Na-chelated FBI molecules is again 0.5 eV, excluding the nature of the ion as responsible of the shift.
It is not worthy to remember here that in REF \cite{stredansky_-surface_2019} crown ether groups were oriented parallel to the Au substrate without any possibility to move or rotate, while in our case, as we will discuss later, the crown ether have more flexibility and mobility and can adopt any conformation with respect to the surface. In fact this mobility and flexibility are also reflected in the N 1s core, which exhibit a shift in the case of \Ba-chelation but not in the case of \Na-chelation.
According to theoretical calculations, upon chelation with \Ba, the FBI suffer a structural torsion promoting that the iminic N atoms at the fluorophore interact with the ions \cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020}. For the case of  while for the case of Na, this torsion has not be predicted. \completar{Fernando: Creo que estos cáclulos con Na no están publicados y los podríamos combinar con los cálculos en los que se ve que la flexibilidad del FBI es muy alta antes de chelarse y menor tras la chelation. \textbf{FER: OK, ya he lanzado el cálculo con Na(+)}}

 

\subsection{Molecular aspect and electronic changes induced by chelation}

\completar{This part is tobe written by Dimas's group. We } The XPS results represent the first evidence of ion trapping by FBI molecules in total absence of any solvent. Second and unambiguous probe is the visualization of the structural and electronic changes that FBI molecules undergone upon chelation. And the best tool to see these changes is the STM. Figure \ref{STM_FBI_fluorophore} a) shows the aspect of the Au(111) after the sublimation of XXXX ML FBI. Molecules tend to aggregate forming islands and individual molecules are difficult to ifentify. The islands crosses the steps, which are not special absorption position for the molecules. An example of this individual momlecules is shown in the the HR-STM image (CO tip, constant height, XXXXX mV) Figure \ref{STM_FBI_fluorophore} b). In this image the fluorophore is clearly distinguish, while the crown ether is very difficult to be measured because crown ether is freely moving. 
Since this molecule is not flat, it is difficult to obtain a good HR-STM image. To compare and to identify the different parts of the molecule, the fluorophore and fluorophore with phenyl ring were also sublimated. In the image we see ..... \completar{Discuss about the STM image of the FBI as well as images for the fluorophore and fluorophore with phenyl ring.}

\subsection{FBI chelation independent of the surfaces}

Finally we have also tested that chelation is taken place also in other surfaces, in particular Cu(111) and ITO. We chose Cu(111) because it is a more reactive substrate. This enabled us to study whether the molecule-substrate interaction could alter the chelation response. On the other hand, ITO was selected because it is a transparent substrate which allows the direct detection of fluorescence. \completar{justificar por qué Cu(111) e ITO}. 

As we saw before, the O 1s shift can be used as fingerprint of the chelation. Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Cu_ITO} shows the O 1s core level measured for FBI deposited on Cu(111) and ITO. For Cu(111) we observed the same chemical shifts on the O 1s, indicating that chelation was also happening. In this case, the core level has a small component at lower B.E., around 531 eV, which is associated to residual contamination of the Cu surface in the form of Cu$_2$O \cite{zhu_surface_2013}
The analysis of the shift for the case of ITO was not as direct because of the presence of oxygen in the ITO structure. To assess the differences associated to the FBI and chelated FBI molecules the core level measured on the ITO as prepared  was subtracted from that measured with FBI and BaCl$_2$. The result of the subtraction is shown in figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Cu_ITO} b), and the inset gathers the original normalized spectra, including the contribution from the ITO. From the shift towards higher B.E. in figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Cu_ITO} b), we see that chelation is also taking place in ITO. These results ensure that chelation is independent from the choice of substrate, and that it is a property intrinsic to the molecule in conjugation with \Ba.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

 The molecular evaporations were done on three Au(111), Cu(111) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The surfaces were cleaned by cycles of sputtering and annealing and their cleanness was checked by XPS prior to FBI deposition. FBI, \BaCl and NaCl were evaporated from homemade knudsen cells. To avoid cross talking between FBI and the salts molecules and to exclude any possibility of chelation of the molecule inside the cell, the FBI and \BaCl  evaporators were located in two separated parts of the chamber.
 
The evaporation thickness was estimated using the attenuation of the most intense substrate core level, i.e. Au 4f, Cu 2p and In 3d. The calculations followed the guidelines provided in ref. \cite{powell_practical_2020}. For this purpose, we estimated the Electron Effective Attenuation (EAL) of electrons through the FBI layers for electrons with kinetic energies of 1402.6, 1041.6 and 554.61 eV (Au 4f 5/2, In 3d 5/2 and Cu 2p 3/2). The resulting EALs are 3.87, 3.05 and 1.85 nm, respectively. The thickness of the FBI samples was then estimated using the intensity of clean substrate core level as reference and the attenuated intensity after the evaporation.  The amount of \Ba (Na) per molecule were estimated XPS analysis  of the  intensity  of  Ba 3d  and  N 1s  core  levels  and considering 3 N atoms per molecule, $\theta=I_{Ba}/3I_N $.
The ratio between the elements is calculated using XXXX with the intensity the total area of the core level. 

The XPS measurements were carried out using a SPECS Phoibos 100 electron analyzer, using a non monochromatic Al K$\alpha$ photon source, (1486.6 eV).Three different substrates were use: Au(111), Cu(111) and  ITO/quartz. The three were cleaned in UHV by sputtering annealing cycles and the cleanness were tested by XPS before deposition of FBI. The spectra were calibrated to the substrates main core level (Au 4f, Cu 2p, and In 3d, respectively).
