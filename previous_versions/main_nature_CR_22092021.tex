\begin{abstract}

Chemical sensors are miniaturised devices widely used to get instant information on the presence of specific compounds or ions in even  complex environments. Used in many fields, recently fluorescence chemo-sensors are under exploration as potentially unique tools in the field of neutrino particle physics. Albeit complex experimental programs has been conducted over more than fifty years searching for neutrinoless double beta (\bbonu) decay, the extremely rare reaction is still making its detection almost impossible. The propose solution to discriminant this event against background noise associated to natural radioactivity is the detection of the daughter atom of the decay, which in the particular case of \XE\ is \Bapp\ . 
Here we unambiguously demonstrate the feasibility of using a crown ether based molecules, fluorescent bicolor indicators (FBI), as the building block of a barium tagging sensor in vacuum conditions. Thanks to the combination of complementary surface science techniques, we unravel the ion capture mechanism once the molecules are immobilized on a surface, and explain the origin of the emission fluorescence shift associated to the trapping of different ions.

\maketitle

The rare neutrinoless double beta  (\bbonu) decay, $(Z,A) \rightarrow (Z+2,A) + 2\ e^{-}$, can occur if and only if neutrinos are Majorana particles \cite{Majorana:1937}, e.g., identical to their antiparticles. An unambiguous observation of such decay would have deep implications in particle physics and cosmology\cite{Sakharov1967,Fukugita:1986hr, GellMann:1980vs, Yanagida:1979as, Mohapatra:1979ia}. The experiments specifically designed for its detection, such as the experiments based on the \XE\ isotope, although promising  \cite{Gando:2016ji} have to improve their sensitivity by at least one, and eventually two orders of magnitude \cite{Gomez-Cadenas:2019sfa}. Using the present technology used in the neutrino field, the searche of this rare event will require very large exposures, measured in ton-years, and even more importantly, a greatly enhanced capability to suppress spurious events. 
Most of this troubles can be overcome by being able to detect the ions that appears after the \bbonu\ decay process. Thus, in the particular case of experiments based on Xe isotope, the process $\XE \rightarrow Ba  + 2\ e \, (+ 2\ \overline{\nu}_{e})$, will create a \Bapp\ dication in xenon gas, and no known radioactive process will produce the appearance of this ion, {\it in  coincidence with two electrons}. 

The detection of these ions by means of chemical sensors, in particular fluorescent sensors, was proposed by in 20215 for a high pressure xenon TPC experiment\cite{Nygren_2015}. Fluorescent molecules that change their optical properties upon detecting the target ion were considered promising tool to increase discrimination by at least an order of magnitude.\cite{valeur_chemical}. The particularity, compared to conventional environmental or biological/medical fluorescent sensors, is that these \bbonu\ sensors  imperatively have to efficiently operate in a controllable noble gas atmosphere, and therefore ion trapping must happen in a dry/vacuum medium. 

A variety in chemical design of fluorescent dyes has been proposed as candidates to be incorporated to the sensing surface of a detector.\cite{valeur_chemical,wolfbeis_materials_2005,Jones:2016qiq, McDonald:2017izm, thapa_barium_2019, thapa_demonstration_2021,D1CP01203G} Among them, a new family of Fluorescent Bicolor Indicators (FBI) has been designed and has been revealed as, at present, the optimal molecular sensor for TPC.\cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020} The advantage, compared to other molecules, is that this molecule (structure on Figure \ref{ModeloFBI}), which displayed strong green emission, shifts its emission spectrum ~30-nm toward the blue region once the molecules bound tightly \Bapp ions. This separation, perfectly visible for molecules in solution, can be used as fingerprint in the final experiments. And, in fact, the first experiment testing them in conditions closed to the final detector (out of solution) has been recently discussed in \cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020}. In that case the FBI molecules were embedded on a silica pellet and then exposed to a barium perchlorate atmosphere. Using ultraviolet light the solid sample shows the desirable blue shifted emission spectra, that indicates the \Bapp\ bonding. Although in that particular case the barium perchlorates were sublimated in a high vacuum chamber, using a Knudsen cell, the ion trapping can not be consider as done in a controllable dry/vacuum medium. Silica pellets is a very rough and porous material were neither density of molecular indicators nor the aggregation and/or presence of solvent traces are under control. Furthermore, since optical tests were performed out of the vacuum chamber, interaction between the indicators and the Ba(ClO$_4$)$_2$ could be affected by exogenous agents, such as ambient water vapor. Therefore, although very promising, the demonstration was far of being conclusive to unambiguously demonstrate the ion trapping in absence of any solvent.

In the present paper we address this issue using a pure surface science approach. The FBI molecules sublimated in a ultra high vacumm (UHV) chamber over perfectly clean surfaces were tested using highly sensitive techniques, X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STM/STS), to  prove how ions, also sublimated in UHV, interact with the FBI functionalized surface.  We demonstrate that only \Bapp\ ions induce molecular structural changes, modifying the electronic structure and therefore affect the fluorescence emission. Since experiment happens entirely in ultra-high vacuum, we ensure that chemical, structural and electronic changes are independent of solvents, air molecules or spurious contaminants. This is, therefore, a crucial step toward the development of a \Bapp\ detector.

\end{figure*}  

Furthermore, this study has also important implications beyond neutrino particle physics field. The FBI molecule structure consists on a crown ether connected to a benzo[a]imidazo[5,1,2-cd]indolizine fluorophore by a phenyl group. The benzoimidazoindolizine group has been shown to have highly tunable bright emission\cite{Stasyuk_benzo,Levesque_general} while the crown ether is capable of interacting with many different ions \cite{valeur_chemical,maleknia_cavity-size-dependent_2002}. The calculations predicts that, in the presence of a \Bapp\ ion, coordination happens towards both the crown ether and phenyl ring, causing a large torsion relative to the free molecule. This induces a large change in the electronic properties of the dye, causing a blue-shift in emission visible even to the naked eye. (Figure \ref{ModeloFBI}).  
This quality is very important in applications such as drug carriers \cite{uchegbu_non-ionic_1998}, photo-switching devices \cite{malval_photoswitching_2002,uda_membrane_2005} or even for the detection of Ra atoms. However, despite their unique coordinating properties\cite{more_intrinsic_1999,dobler1981ionophores,maleknia_cavity-size-dependent_2002}, crown ethers have been poorly exploited in solid state, and only few examples can be found in the literature where self-assembled monolayers of crown ether derivatives have been grown on surfaces\cite{yoshimoto_hostguest_2003,flink_recognition_1999,inokuchi_new_2015}  and, in all of them, either the growth or ion trapping or both has taken place in solution. 
 There are only two works, as far as we know, where crown ethers were deposited under ultra high vacuum conditions (UHV) \cite{feng_growth_2018,stredansky_-surface_2019}. 
Thus, in addition, the work presented here advances substantially the understanding of the properties of crown ethers immobilised in solid surfaces.

%\section{Results and discussion}

\section{Molecular sublimation in vacuum}
Since we want to characterize the ion trapping capability of the molecules immobilized on a surface, it is mandatory to deposit the FBI molecule on a clean surface in a very controlled environment. Thus, as a first step in our study, FBI molecules were sublimated on a gold substrate (see lower panel of figure \ref{ModeloFBI}) inside a UHV chamber. To determine their chemical composition, we used XPS. Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} a) shows the XPS spectra of the three molecular core levels of FBI, i.e. O 1s, N 1s and C 1s. The spectra were measured for 0.65 ML deposited on Au(111) at RT. The ratios between the core levels, C/O = 6.2, C/N = 10.3, are in agreement with having stoichiometric molecules on the surface $ C_{31}N_{3}O_{5}H_{35}$. The C 1s core level, which appears centred at around 285 eV, can be fitted using two components, one centred at around 284.7 eV and a second and more intense one at 286.3 eV, with relative intensities in agreement with having intact molecules. The former component corresponds to C-C bonds whereas the component at higher binding energy (B.E.) includes contributions from C-O and C-N. In the N 1s region, around 400.4 eV, a faint peak is visible. The position of the maximum is compatible with the two amide groups of the molecular composition. Finally, the O 1s core level present a single component peak centred at 533.0 eV compatible with the position of this peak as reported in ref \cite{stredansky_-surface_2019}. 

In addition to the XPS analysis, we have confirmed the intact sublimation of the molecules by STM. Deposition of a submonolayer of FBI resulted mostly in disordered islands coexisting with isolated molecules (Figure \ref{Large Scale STM images of FBI} a)). STM images of the single molecules (inserted in Figure  \ref{FIG_BRSTM.png}a) show two main lobes corresponding to the chromophore and the crown-ether parts, the former appearing lower and flatter than the latter. STM measurements with CO-functionalized probes in the repulsive tip-sample interaction regime can render bond-resolving images of planar organic molecules.\cite{gross_recent_2011,gross_atomic_2018} Application of this measurement mode to the FBI results in images as displayed in Fig. \ref{FIG_BRSTM.png}b. Whereas the internal bonding structure of the chromophore is approximately resolved, that is not the case for the crown-ether, due to its larger flexibility and its non-planarity. As a consequence, the contrast in the crown-ether part of the image is an artifact related to excessively strong interactions with the flexible CO tip-apex.\cite{moll_mechanisms_2010,hapala_mechanism_2014} To ensure the imaging signature of the chromophore, we also imaged FBI derivatives specifically synthesised without the crown ether. Figure  \ref{FIG_BRSTM.png}c and d show the high resolution bond-resolving images of FBI derivatives sublimated on Au(111) surface, one without the phenyl ring nor the crown ether (Fig. \ref{FIG_BRSTM.png}c)  and the other with phenyl ring but without the crown ether (Fig. \ref{FIG_BRSTM.png}d). The absence of the crown ether allowed the molecules on the surface to adopt a planar configuration and clearly improved the images, with the carbon framework of the molecule well-visualized. In turn, this supports our previous assignment of the different parts when measuring the original FBI molecules and confirms their unchanged chemical structure upon sublimation.

\section{Chemical probe of chelation}
For the chelation, \BappCl\ was sublimated on the FBI-functionalised Au(111) surface. When pure \BappCl\ was deposited on the Au(111) surface, its stoichiometry ratio Ba:Cl was 1:2 as expected. However, when it was deposited on FBI-functionalized Au(111), this ratio was around 1:1.3 and 1:1.6, meaning that some chlorine was desorbed when it reached the sample. From simulations \cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020}, the chlorine is expected to behave as a passive expectator in the chelation, so it is consistent that it desorbs when the molecule is present.


After sublimation of 0.80 \Bapp per FBI molecule, the core levels, shown in figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} b), are clearly shifted toward higher B.E, mainly on O 1s and N 1s. The maximum O 1s core level exhibits an upward chemical shift of 0.5 eV. This shift is not just a doping shift, but a real chemical change. This is revealed by the evolution of the O 1s for very low \Bapp doses on the surface. Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)}d shows the evolution of the O 1s for incremental amount of \Bapp ions. The Ba dose was stimated using the ratio between XPS intensities of spectra of Ba 2p and N 1s core level divided by the correspoding sensitivity factor, and always having into account that there are 3 N atoms per molecule. Thus, the Ba per FBI molecule runs from 0 to almost 0.5 , i.e. until 2 FBI moelcules per 1 \BappCl. The FBI coverage in this case is 0.9 ML. Once \BappCl\ is added to the sample, in the O 1s core level a second component, at higher binding energy appears, which makes that the peak width increases. At the latest state of barium addition, the FWHM increases by 9\% with respect to the free state. We deconvolve the peaks after \Bapp addition using two components, one at 533.2 (FWHM = 2.20) corresponding to the free molecules and another at 533.8-534.0 eV, corresponding to chelated molecules. This is consistent with the molecules undergoing a chemical change upon chelation, as Stredansky and coworkers observed for crown ether chelation with Na.\cite{stredansky_-surface_2019}  The close proximity of the Au 4p core level affects the O 1s core level intensity (inserted for illustration in Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)}d) hinder us to give an estimation of the chelation (trapping) efficiency. Mention that, in order to enhance the core level evolution and remark the spectral serie shown in Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)}d corresponds to O 1s core region upon subtraction of the Au 4p contribution. 

To evaluate whether the nature of the dopant atom has any influence in the oxygen core level shift for the FBI molecules, we tested the chelation with \Nap. Thus, figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} c) shows the O 1s, N 1s and C 1s core levels measured on 0.6 ML of FBI on Au(111) before and after the sublimation of 2.60 \Nap per FBI. The maximum O 1s shift for \Nap-chelated FBI molecules is again 0.5 eV, excluding the nature of the ion as responsible of the shift. However no shift was detected for N 1s nor C 1s core levels. Having into account the high flexibility and mobility reported for the FBI molecules, this XPS discrepancy between \Bapp\- and \Nap-chelation can be interpreted as a first probe that molecular torsion varies depending on the nature of the trapped ions. According to theoretical calculations, upon chelation with \Bapp, the FBI undergo a structural torsion promoting the interaction between the iminic N atom at the fluorophore and the ions \cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020}. On the contrary, for the case of \Nap the ion does not produce the torsion given its smaller size. 




\section{Molecular structural rearrangement induced by chelation}

In order to visualize the aforementioned structural changes undergone by the FBI molecules upon chelation along with the modified electronic properties as measured at the single molecule level, STM experiments were carried out. Thus, STM evidences of the findings are summarized in Figure \ref{Fig_STS}. 

\begin{figure*}[ht!]
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/Fig_STS.png}
	\caption{\label{Fig_STS} 
    (a) Schematic diagram of metal intercalation. (b-d) STM images of (b) \Nap-complexed (U = 0.9 V, I = 60 pA), (c) native (U = 1.4 V, I = 60 pA), and (d) \Bapp-complexed (U = -1.8 V, I = 20 pA) FBI. (Scale bars = 0.5 nm) (e) STS spectra of native (dark), \Nap-complexed (red), and \Bapp-complexed (green) FBI.}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{Fig_STS}a shows the schematic representation of the FBI molecules before and after chelation with \Nap and \Bapp, whereas Fig. \ref{Fig_STS}b-d displays representative STM images next to each of the cases. The contrast in STM images is always determined by a convolution of topographical and electronic contributions. However, the observed changes in constant current mode images obtained at bias voltages well inside the molecular HOMO-LUMO gap still support the expected conformation changes. The complexation of crown-ethers with alkali metals like \Nap causes the oxygen atoms to point to the center, forcing the ring to adopt a flatter conformation relative to the native molecule. Instead, calculations predict the FBI molecule to adopt a more three-dimensional conformation upon chelation with \Bapp. Taking into account that the three STM images are plotted with a common color code, it can be directly observed that the apparent heights of the crown ether follow the expected trend. Indeed, the apparent height for each of the molecules, as measured on the highest point of the crown, is 2.5$\pm$ 0.1 \AA, 2.1$\pm$ 0.1 \AA, and 2.9$\pm$ 0.1 \AA, for the pristine FBI and the \Nap and \Bapp chelated molecules, respectively.    
The associated STS spectroscopy revealed a HOMO-LUMO gap of 3.0 eV for the FBI molecule deposited on Au(111) (Figure \ref{Fig_STS}e). Complexation with \Nap did not considerably change this bandgap, while complexation with \Bapp increased it to 3.6 eV. According to calculations, the HOMO and LUMO are mainly located around the dye and are determined by its $\pi$-network, with little contribution from the crown ether (Figure ?). A simple complexation between the crown ether and \Nap therefore does not change this gap substantially. This is in line with other dyes containing the same crown ether whose emission profiles do not change upon \Nap complexation.\cite{ast_high_2011} Meanwhile, the conformational change upon complexation with \Bapp causes a decrease in the extent of pi-conjugation, which no longer extends into the phenyl ring linking the fluorophore and the crown, consequently increasing the bandgap. This is in line with the changes in absorption and emission spectra.

\section{Chelation independent of the surface support}

Finally we have also tested that chelation is taken place also in other surfaces, in particular Cu(111) and ITO. We chose Cu(111) because it is a more reactive substrate. This enabled us to study whether the molecule-substrate interaction could alter the chelation response. On the other hand, ITO was selected because it is a transparent substrate which allows the direct detection of fluorescence. Furthermore, the conductivity of ITO could enable guiding the \Bapp ions towards the surface in order for the molecules to capture it. These properties make ITO a promising candidate for the potential implementation of a barium tagging detector on a xenon-based TPC\cite{rivilla_fluorescent_2020}.

% For the Cu(111) sample, the Ba/FBI ratio = 10 (revised with proper area and ASF) i.e. much higher rate than for the Au(111) experiment. For the NaCl evaporation, the Na/FBI ratio = 3.66. 

% In the ITO sample, the Ba/FBI ratio = 17.5

As we saw, the O 1s shift is a fingerprint of chelation. Figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Cu_ITO} shows the O 1s core level of FBI on Cu(111) and ITO. For Cu(111), we observed the same chemical shift on the O 1s (0.7 towards higher BE), indicating that chelation was also happening. In this case, the core level has a smaller component at lower B.E., around 531 eV, which is associated to residual contamination of the Cu surface in the form of Cu$_2$O \cite{zhu_surface_2013}.
The analysis of the shift for the case of ITO was not as direct because of the presence of oxygen in the ITO structure. To assess the differences associated to the FBI and chelated FBI molecules the core level measured on the ITO as prepared  was subtracted from that measured with FBI and BaCl$_2$. The result of the subtraction is shown in figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Cu_ITO} b), and the inset gathers the original normalized spectra, including the contribution from the ITO. From the 0.9 eV shift towards higher B.E. in figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Cu_ITO} b), we see that chelation is also taking place in ITO. These results ensure that chelation is independent from the choice of substrate, and that it is a property intrinsic to the molecule in conjugation with \Bapp.

\section{Conclusions}
Detecting the single \Bapp\ ion produced in the double beta decay of \XE\ could be the basis of a xenon-based \bbonu\ experiment able to achieve extremely low levels o background, which in turn may facilitate a major discovery. Such detection requires the funcionalisation of suitable surfaces, such as ITO, with thin layers of chemo-sensors able to efficiently and selectively trap \Bapp\ while providing a clear separation between chelated and free molecules. The whole process must occur in dry atmosphere, without the mediation of solvents or contaminants. In this paper we have shown that FBI indicator can indeed be arranged in monolayers, and have demonstrated chelation in vacuum of such molecules by \Bapp\ ions. We have studied the chemical and conformational changes that occur upon chelation, and compared them with our calculations which predict the behaviour of the molecules, finding excellent agreement. Chelation occurs independently of the surface, thus providing considerable freedom to choose the substrate and the measured spectrum shift is consistent with the observed bi-color property of the sensor. Thus, this work establishes the suitability of the FBI indicator as the core component of sensors of monolayers able to operate in a future xenon detector. 

\section{Methods}

 The molecular evaporations were done on three surfaces: Au(111), Cu(111) (single crystals) and Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin layer grown on quartz. The surfaces were cleaned by cycles of sputtering and annealing and their cleanness was checked by XPS prior to FBI deposition. Pure FBI, \BappCl and NaCl were evaporated from homemade Knudsen cells. To avoid cross talking between FBI and the salts molecules and to exclude any possibility of chelation of the molecule inside the cell, the FBI and \BappCl  evaporators were located in two separated parts of the chamber.
 
The evaporation thickness was estimated by studying the attenuation of the most intense substrate core level, i.e. Au 4f, Cu 2p and In 3d. The calculations followed the guidelines provided in ref. \cite{powell_practical_2020}. For this purpose, we estimated the Electron Effective Attenuation (EAL) of electrons through the FBI layers for electrons with kinetic energies of 1402.6, 1041.6 and 554.61 eV (Au 4f 5/2, In 3d 5/2 and Cu 2p 3/2, respectively). The resulting EALs are 3.87, 3.05 and 1.85 nm, respectively. The thickness of the FBI samples was then estimated using the intensity of clean substrate core level as reference and the attenuated intensity after the evaporation. The amount of \Bapp (Na) per molecule were estimated by computing  the ratio $\theta=I_{Ba}/(I_N/3) \cdot S_N/S_{Ba} $, where $I_{Ba}$, $I_N$ is total area  of the  Ba 3d 5/2 and  N 1s  core  levels and $S_{Ba} = 25.84$, $S_N = 1.80$ are the corresponding atomic sensitivity factors\cite{scofield_hartree-slater_1976}. The factor 3 corresponds to considering 3 N atoms per molecule.

The XPS measurements were carried out using a SPECS Phoibos 100 electron analyzer, using a non monochromatic Al K$\alpha$ photon source, (1486.6 eV).Three different substrates were use: Au(111), Cu(111) and  ITO/quartz. The three were cleaned in UHV by sputtering annealing cycles and the cleanness were tested by XPS before deposition of FBI. The spectra were calibrated to the substrates main core level (Au 4f, Cu 2p, and In 3d, respectively).

The intensity of the clean sample (red line) was subtracted from that corresponding to the deposition of FBI molecule (green line). To account for the attenuation of the Au 4p peak after evaporating the molecule, the maximum intensity of both curves was normalized to unity. The same treatment was applied to all lines in figure \ref{XPS_FBI_Au(111)} d) displayed here as inset.}

%% This is outdated: the stoichiometry of pure BaCl2 was actually 2, as expected. We were computing wrong the area of the Ba 3d 5/2 peak. Also the Auger parameter was compatible with literature results for BaCl2

%    Evaporation of \BappCl directly (with no FBI molecule layer in between) on Cu(111) (black line) and Au(111) (red line). The stoichiometry ratio Cl/Ba, taking into account the atomic sensitivity factors (0.89 and 7.49 for Cl 2p and Ba 3d, respectively) is 0.7 and 0.64, for deposition in Au and Cu, respectively. Compare this to the expected ratio of 2 for the stoichiometric \BappCl salt. The intensity of chlorine did not change during the data acquisition, so desorption of chlorine due to the irradiation of X-rays was ruled out. Therefore, we attribute this low abundance of chlorine to the formation of gas Cl$_2$ either by interaction of the salt with the substrate or during the evaporation itself. In the case of NaCl evaporation, the presence of Cl 2p was below our detection sensitivity. The Ba 3d 5/2 and 3/2 peak are centered around 780.8 and 796.2 eV, respectively, which correspond to metallic barium \cite{jacobi_chemical_1987}. This is again consistent with the salt being dissociated and the barium stabilized upon interaction with the surface. Ba 3d from crystalline \BappCl would have these peaks centered around 777.5 and 792.8 eV (Ba 3d 5/2 and 3/2, respectively) \cite{kamada_solid-state_nodate}. Furthermore, the chemical state of barium in halides can be identified by differences in the ``Auger parameter" \cite{berrie_auger_1991, berrie_chemical_1994} $\alpha = KE(\mathrm{AES}) - KE(\mathrm{PE})$, i.e. the energy shift between a photoemission peak and the corresponding Auger peak. This parameter, when measured between the Ba 3d 5/2 and Ba M$_4$N$_{4,5}$N$_{4,5}$, takes values around 123.7 eV for BaO and \BappCl, whereas we measure a value of 105 eV. This value is compatible with that of metallic Ba \cite{vasquez_x-ray_1991}. The same holds for the state of barium in FBI-Ba samples: the Auger parameter is $\alpha = 109$ eV, and the Ba 3d 5/2, 3/2 peaks are centered around 780.9 and 796.2 eV, respectively.}
