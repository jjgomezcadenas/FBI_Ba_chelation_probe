	title = {Towards a background-free neutrinoless double beta decay experiment based on a fluorescent bicolor sensor},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02782},
	abstract = {Searching for neutrinoless double beta decays (\${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta0{\textbackslash}nu\$) is the only practical way to establish if the neutrinos are their own antiparticles. Due to the smallness of neutrino masses, the lifetime of \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta0{\textbackslash}nu\$ is expected to be at least ten orders of magnitude smaller than the noise associated with the natural radioactive chains. A positive identification of \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta0{\textbackslash}nu\$ decays requires, ultimately, finding a signal that cannot be mimicked by radioactive backgrounds. This signal could be the observation of the daughter atom in the decay, since no known background processes induce a Z+2 transformation. In particular, the \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta0{\textbackslash}nu\$ decay of Xe-136 could be established by detecting the doubly ionised daughter atom, Ba\${\textasciicircum}\{2+\}\$. Such a detection could be achieved via a sensor made of a monolayer of molecular indicators. The Ba\${\textasciicircum}\{2+\}\$ would be captured by one of the molecules in the sensor, and the presence of the single chelated indicator would be subsequently revealed by a strong fluorescent response from repeated interrogation with a laser system. Here we describe a fluorescent bicolor indicator that binds strongly to Ba\${\textasciicircum}\{2+\}\$ and shines very brightly, shifting its emission colour from green to blue when chelated in dry medium, thus allowing the unambiguous identification of single barium atoms in the sensor, and permitting a positive identification of the \${\textbackslash}beta{\textbackslash}beta0{\textbackslash}nu\$ decay of Xe-136 in a gas chamber, that could led to a background-free experiment.},

It is found that these reactions take place via tandem [π8s + π2s] and [σ2s + π6s + σ2s] processes. The [8 + 2] cycloaddition steps are essentially barrierless, and the aromatization steps occur via highly synchronous aromatic transition structures. From an experimental standpoint, the reaction is feasible under microwave irradiation and using 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl triflates as benzyne precursors. Depending on the substitution pattern in the starting triflate a complete regiocontrol of the reaction can be achieved. The tetracyclic compounds thus prepared emitted blue light when excited at 365 nm and exhibited interesting photophysical properties.},

Values of the EAL, MED, and ID will also depend on the elastic-scattering properties of the sample and the experimental configuration.

A comparison of the photoelectron binding energies and Auger electron kinetic energies of the exchangeable cations with those of corresponding halides and oxides reveals that they fall among those of corresponding cations in typical ionic compounds such as fluorides and chlorides. On the other hand, the bonding state of the non-exchangeable Mg ion in montmorillonite lattice, as indicated by the Mg ls and KL2, 3L2, 3 Auger electron energies, is similar to that of magnesium oxide and distinguishable from that of the exchangeable Mg ion.},

The majority of the Sr and Ba compounds measured here have cation core level binding energies which are lower than that of the metal, with the negative shifts largest for high temperature superconductors. These data are interpreted within a point charge model, which has previously been used to interpret XPS data from alkali halides and other ionic compounds. Data reported in the literature reveal that, rather than being anomalous, small or negative binding energy shifts are common to many ionic compounds. It is suggested that the large negative shifts observed for the high temperature superconductors are a consequence of large Madelung energies at the cation sites, and may be a measure of the hole distribution on the Cu-O planes. Measurements of the energy loss regions from the core levels of the Sr compounds are also reported. A peak which has previously been assigned as a configuration interaction satellite of the Sr4s peak is shown to be a plasmon loss from the Sr4p peak.},

	abstract = {X-ray photoelectron spectra of Cl and Zn core electrons have been obtained for crystals (ZnCl2, Cs2ZnCl4, CsCl and BaCl2) and glasses (ZnCl2 and modified ZnCl2 systems containing CsCl and BaCl2). Binding energies of the Cl core electrons of the crystals decrease by about 1 eV in the order ZnCl2, Cs2ZnCl4 and CsCl or BaCl2. This is attributed to the difference in bonding nature between Zn-Cl and M-Cl bonds where M = Cs or Ba. Therefore, Cl- ions in different bonding states, i.e. bridging, nonbridging and isolated, are discriminated from each other by the XPS of Cl core electrons; here, the term `bridging', `nonbridging' or `isolated' represent Cl- ions which are bound to two Zn2+, one Zn2+, or no Zn2+, respectively. The Cl core electron binding energies of ZnCl2 glass are the same as those of ZnCl2 crystal. However, a decrease is seen in ZnCl2-CsCl-BaCl2 glasses. This is because nonbridging Cl- ions are introduced into the modified glasses. The Cl2p spectra of the modified glasses are successfully decomposed into four Lorentz-Gaussian lines, the peak positions of which are close to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 of bridging and nonbridging Cl- ions in crystals. The binding energies of Zn core electrons decrease for Cs2ZnCl4 and the modified glasses. This is explained by the change in formal charge of ZnCl4 tetrahedra and the relaxation of the final state.},

The formation of a hydrogen bond between the two molecular species anchors the BA molecules to the CA. The structure is homogeneous in terms of its morphology and chemical properties. We also show that the structure (molecular orientation) of the BA SAM formed on the CA SAM is different from that of the BA SAM on the bare Au surface.

The amino-carboxylic interaction thereby drives the formation of a monolayer of guest molecules, regularly distributed at the nanometer scale, preventing their aggregation in unordered clusters observed on a bare gold surface.

Besides the conduction-band region of bulk Ba the 5p and 4d levels are studied, both showing surface core-level shifts of 0.48 eV to higher binding energies. At EF and extending down to 0.7 eV, d states are identified in the bulk conduction band. For the bulk, oxidation introduces negative (towards EF) chemical shifts of the core levels and a very sharp O2− peak in the valence-band region. It is argued that these oxygen-2p-derived states, and not the Ba 5d states, are responsible for the negative chemical shift. For the Ba monolayer the chemical shift is positive and no O2− state is found, in agreement with the new interpretation of the chemical shifts for bulk Ba.},

	abstract = {Observation of the neutrinoless double β decay is the only practical way to establish that neutrinos are their own antiparticles1. Because of the small masses of neutrinos, the lifetime of neutrinoless double β decay is expected to be at least ten orders of magnitude greater than the typical lifetimes of natural radioactive chains, which can mimic the experimental signature of neutrinoless double β decay2. The most robust identification of neutrinoless double β decay requires the definition of a signature signal—such as the observation of the daughter atom in the decay—that cannot be generated by radioactive backgrounds, as well as excellent energy resolution. In particular, the neutrinoless double β decay of 136Xe could be established by detecting the daughter atom, 136Ba2+, in its doubly ionized state3–8. Here we demonstrate an important step towards a ‘barium-tagging’ experiment, which identifies double β decay through the detection of a single Ba2+ ion. We propose a fluorescent bicolour indicator as the core of a sensor that can detect single Ba2+ ions in a high-pressure xenon gas detector. In a sensor made of a monolayer of such indicators, the Ba2+ dication would be captured by one of the molecules and generate a Ba2+-coordinated species with distinct photophysical properties. The presence of such a single Ba2+-coordinated indicator would be revealed by its response to repeated interrogation with a laser system, enabling the development of a sensor able to detect single Ba2+ ions in high-pressure xenon gas detectors for barium-tagging experiments.},

Since the electronics typically include different elements such as an insulating substrate in combination with conducting electrodes, an important issue of bioelectronics involves tailoring and optimizing the interface for any envisioned applications. In this paper, we present a method for functionalizing insulating substrates (SiO2) and metallic electrodes (Pt) simultaneously with a stable monolayer of organic molecules ((3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)). This monolayer is characterized by high molecule density, long-term stability, and positive surface net charge and most likely represents a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). It facilitates the conversion of biounfriendly Pt surfaces into biocompatible surfaces, which allows cell growth (neurons) on both functionalized components, SiO2 and Pt, which is comparable to that of reference samples coated with poly-L-lysine (PLL). Moreover, the functionalization greatly improves the electronic cell–chip coupling, thereby enabling the recording of action potential signals of several millivolts at APTES-functionalized Pt electrodes.},

	abstract = {The nature of the neutrino is one of the major open questions in experimental nuclear and particle physics. The most sensitive known method to establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino is detection of the ultra-rare process of neutrinoless double beta decay. However, identification of one or a handful of decay events within a large mass of candidate isotope, without obfuscation by backgrounds is a formidable experimental challenge. One hypothetical method for achieving ultra- low-background neutrinoless double beta decay sensitivity is the detection of single 136Ba ions produced in the decay of 136Xe (“barium tagging”). To implement such a method, a single-ion-sensitive barium detector must be developed and demonstrated in bulk liquid or dry gaseous xenon. This paper reports on the development of two families of dry-phase barium chemosensor molecules for use in high pressure xenon gas detectors, synthesized specifically for this purpose. One particularly promising candidate, an anthracene substituted aza-18-crown-6 ether, is shown to respond in the dry phase with almost no intrinsic background from the unchelated state, and to be amenable to barium sensing through fluorescence microscopy. This interdisciplinary advance, paired with earlier work demonstrating sensitivity to single barium ions in solution, opens a new path toward single ion detection in high pressure xenon gas.},

This has potential to significantly enhance the sensitivity of searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay (0νββ) that is obscured by background radiation events. The chemistry required to make such sensitive detection of Ba2+ by SMFI in dry Xe gas at solid interfaces has implications for solid-phase detection methods but has not been demonstrated. Here, we synthesized simple, robust, and effective Ba2+-selective chemosensors capable of function within ultrapure high-pressure 136Xe gas. Turn-on fluorescent naphthalimide-(di)azacrown ether chemosensors were Ba2+-selective and achieved SMFI in a polyacrylamide matrix. Fluorescence and NMR experiments supported a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism for turn-on sensing. Ba2+ selectivity was achieved with computational calculations correctly predicting the fluorescence responses of sensors to barium, mercury, and potassium ions. With these molecules, dry-phase single-Ba2+ ion imaging with turn-on fluorescence was realized using an oil-free microscopy technique for the first time—a significant advance toward single-Ba2+ ion detection within large volumes of 136Xe, plausibly enabling a background-independent technique to search for the hypothetical process of 0νββ.},

The method adapts Single Molecule Fluorescent Imaging, a technique from biochemistry research with demonstrated single ion sensitivity. We explore possible SMFI dyes suitable for the problem of barium ion detection in high pressure xenon gas, and develop a fiber-coupled sensing system with which we can detect the presence of bulk Ba++ ions remotely. We show that our sensor produces signal-to-background ratios as high as 85 in response to Ba++ ions when operated in aqueous solution. We then describe the next stage of this R\&D program, which will be to demonstrate chelation and fluorescence in xenon gas. If a successful barium ion tag can be developed using SMFI adapted for high pressure xenon gas detectors, the first essentially zero background, ton-scale neutrinoless double beta decay technology could be realized.},

Since then a number of groups world wide have studied non-ionic surfactant vesicles (niosomes) with a view to evaluating their potential as drug carriers. This article presents a summary of the achievements in the field to date. Niosomes may be formed form a diverse array of amphiphiles bearing sugar, polyoxyethylene, polyglycerol, crown ether and amino acid hydrophilic head groups and these amphiphiles typically possess one to two hydrophobic alkyl, perfluoroalkyl or steroidal groups. The self assembly of surfactants into niosomes is governed not only by the nature of the surfactant but by the presence of membrane additives, the nature of the drug encapsulated and the actual method of preparation. Methods of niosome preparation and the number of different morphologies that have been identified are detailed. The influence of formulation factors on niosome stability is also examined as are methods to optimise drug loading. In vivo these systems have been evaluated as immunological adjuvants, anti-cancer/anti-infective drug targeting agents and carriers of anti-inflammatory drugs. Niosomes have also been used in diagnostic imaging. Efforts to achieve transdermal and ophthalmic drug delivery with some formulations are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of M+[c-(C2H4O)5] and M+[c-(C2H4O)6] for M = Na, K, Rb, and Cs are reported. The BDEs are determined experimentally by analysis of the thresholds for collision-induced dissociation of the cation−crown ether complexes by xenon measured by using guided ion beam mass spectrometry. In all cases, the primary and lowest energy dissociation channel observed experimentally is endothermic loss of the ligand molecule. The cross section thresholds are interpreted to yield 0 and 298 K BDEs after accounting for the effects of multiple ion−molecule collisions, internal energy of the complexes, and unimolecular decay rates. For both 18-crown-6 and 15-crown-5, the BDEs decrease monotonically with increasing cation size. These results indicate that the intrinsic affinity of c-(C2H4O)5 and c-(C2H4O)6 for M+ is determined principally by the charge density of the cation not by the ratio of the ionic radius to the cavity size. The BDEs reported here are in fair agreement with recent ab initio calculations at the MP2 level with 6-31+G* basis sets. The experimental values are systematically smaller than the computed values by 8 ± 2 kJ/mol per metal−oxygen interaction. The existence of less strongly bound isomers in the experimental apparatus for Rb+(15-crown-5) and Cs+(15-crown-5) appears likely, but their absence for Na+ and K+ complexes indicates interesting metal-dependent dynamics to the formation of such isomers.},

The effect of varying the substituents on protonated amines of the type [RNH3]+ (R = CH3(CH2)2, C6H5(CH2)2, O2NC6H4(CH2)2 or C6H5CH2C(H)COOH) was found to have a strong influence on the relative intensities of the inclusion complexes formed with crown ethers in competitive gas-phase reactions. Relative intensity measurements indicate that the introduction of an aromatic ring on the protonated amine or crown ether results in the formation of a less stable complex than the nonaromatic protonated propylamine/18-crown-6 adduct. The relative affinities of protonated propylamine and phenethylamine for 18-crown-6 and of phenylalanine for phenyl-18-crown-6 and 18-crown-6 are supported by tandem mass spectrometric and ligand exchange data. The overall order of stabilities for the noncovalent complexes investigated by ion trap mass spectrometry can be assigned tentatively as: [p + H + 18-crown-6]+ {\textgreater} [p + H + benzo-18-crown-6]+ ∼ [(r)-phenyl + H + 18-crown-6]+ = [(s)-phenyl + H + 18-crown-6]+ {\textgreater} [(s)-phenyl + H + (s)-phenyl-18-crown-6]+ {\textgreater} [nitro + H + 18-crown-6]+ {\textgreater} [phen + H + 18-crown-6]+ ∼ [phen + H + benzo-18-crown-6]+, where p = propylamine, phen = phenethylamine, phenyl = phenylalanine, and nitro = 4-nitrophenylalanine.},

Analysis of the response curves with a Langmuir isotherm enables the determination of association constants of the SAMs with various metal ions. The cation binding also influences the charge-transfer resistance (RCT) of a redox couple Ru(NH3)62+/3+ in the electrolyte. Comparison of both responses allows an accurate interpretation of the origin of the resistive response. Furthermore, the association constants enable the quantitative determination of interactions between SAMs and metal ions, using either capacitive or resistive responses.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a powerful spectroscopic technique, surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy, not only for detecting host–guest complexes in solution but also for examining the relationship between the guest selectivity, complex structure, and solvent effect. We synthesize thiol derivatives of 15-crown-5 and 18-crown-6 [2-(6-mercaptohexyloxy)methyl-15-crown-5 (15C5-C1OC6-SH) and 2-(6-mercaptohexyloxy)methyl-18-crown-6 (18C6-C1OC6-SH)], which are adsorbed on gold surfaces through S–Au bonds. The IR difference spectra of the M+·15C5-C1OC6 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) complexes on gold are observed using aqueous solutions of MCl by SEIRA spectroscopy. The spectra show a noticeable change in the C–O stretching vibration at around 1100 cm−1. The spectral patterns of M+·15C5-C1OC6 are similar for Li+ and Na+, and for K+, Rb+, and Cs+; the interaction between the metal ions and 15C5-C1OC6 changes drastically between Na+ and K+ in the series of alkali metal ions. On the other hand, the equilibrium constant for complex formation determined by the IR intensity shows clear preference for Na+ ions. We also observe the IR difference spectra of M+·18C6-C1OC6 in methanol and compare them with those in water. The spectral patterns in methanol are almost the same as those in water, but the equilibrium constant in methanol does not show preference for any ion, different from the K+ preference in water. From these findings we attribute the origin of the ion selectivity of 15C5 and 18C6 in solution to the interaction between the metal ions and the crown ethers in the complexes or the solvation energy of free ions. In the case of 15C5-C1OC6 in water, the preference of Na+ over K+, Rb+, and Cs+ can be attributed to the strength of the interaction or the size matching between metal ions and 15C5-C1OC6; the Na+ selectivity over Li+ ions is dominated by the solvation energy of free ions. For 18C6-C1OC6 in methanol, the equilibrium constant for complex formation becomes much bigger in methanol than that in water and loses the selectivity in methanol, because the solvation energy in methanol is fairly smaller than that in water, predominating the contribution from the strength of the interaction between metal ions and 18C6-C1OC6. The IR spectra measured by SEIRA spectroscopy are quite sensitive to properties of host–guest complexes such as the intermolecular interaction, the structure, and the orientation against the gold surface. However, the evidence for guest selectivity emerges primarily in the intensity of the spectra, rather than band positions or spectral patterns in the IR spectra.},

Chelation of doubly-charged alkaline earth elements such as calcium and barium by certain precursor molecules converts the resulting complex from a non-fluorescent to a fluorescent state. Repeated photo-excitation of a single fluorescent complex reveals both presence and location with high precision. This technique, widespread now in biochemistry, biophysics and biology, may permit a similar discriminating response in a large high-pressure xenon gas TPC for the Ba++ ion from xenon double-beta decay. The TPC measures the event time and energy of the two nascent electrons, as well as topology and position in 3-D from their trajectories in the gas. Measurement of the 2-D location of the molecular ion after arrival at the cathode plane permits an association of ion with the event. Demonstration of an efficient, highly specific detection of the barium daughter would provide a long-sought pathway to a background-free result in the search for this decay mode, of central importance for determining the nature of the neutrino.},

	abstract = {Neutrinos are very special particles. Studies of these particles have played a crucial role in the understanding of the laws of elementary particles and their interactions. Until recently, there was no evidence that neutrinos have masses, and therefore the standard model in elementary particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless. Small but non-zero masses of neutrinos have been discovered by studying neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere. The small neutrino masses have profound implications for our understanding of particle physics and the universe. This paper discusses the discovery of neutrino masses.}

  abstract  = {Neutrinos are very special particles. Studies of these particles have played a crucial role in the understanding of the laws of elementary particles and their interactions. Until recently, there was no evidence that neutrinos have masses, and therefore the standard model in elementary particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless. Small but non-zero masses of neutrinos have been discovered by studying neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere. The small neutrino masses have profound implications for our understanding of particle physics and the universe. This paper discusses the discovery of neutrino masses.},

	abstract = {Using scanning probe microscopy techniques, at low temperatures and in ultrahigh vacuum, individual molecules adsorbed on surfaces can be probed with ultrahigh resolution to determine their structure and details of their conformation, configuration, charge states, aromaticity, and the contributions of resonance structures. Functionalizing the tip of an atomic force microscope with a CO molecule enabled atomic-resolution imaging of single molecules, and measurement of their adsorption geometry and bond-order relations. In addition, by using scanning tunneling microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, the density of the molecular frontier orbitals and the electric charge distribution within molecules can be mapped. Combining these techniques yields a high-resolution tool for the identification and characterization of individual molecules. The single-molecule sensitivity and the possibility of atom manipulation to induce chemical reactions with the tip of the microscope open up unique applications in chemistry, and differentiate scanning probe microscopy from conventional methods for molecular structure elucidation. Besides being an aid for challenging cases in natural product identification, atomic force microscopy has been shown to be a powerful tool for the investigation of on-surface reactions and the characterization of radicals and molecular mixtures. Herein we review the progress that high-resolution scanning probe microscopy with functionalized tips has made for molecular structure identification and characterization, and discuss the challenges it will face in the years to come.},

	abstract = {By functionalizing the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) with a molecule or an atom that significantly contributes to the tip–sample interaction, the resolution can be dramatically enhanced. The interaction and therefore the resolution crucially depend on the chemical nature of the tip termination. Employing a tip functionalized with a CO molecule, atomic resolution of a pentacene molecule was recently demonstrated. In this work, the interaction between the CO tip and the pentacene imaged are studied with first principles calculations. The calculated frequency shifts compare very well with the experiment. The different energy contributions are analyzed and the Pauli energy is computed. We demonstrate that the source of the high resolution is Pauli repulsion, whereas van der Waals and electrostatic interactions only add a diffuse attractive background.},

We present a numerical STM/AFM model, which takes into account the relaxation of the probe due to the tip-sample interaction. We demonstrate that the model is able to reproduce very well not only the experimental intra- and intermolecular contrasts, but also their evolution upon tip approach. At close distances, the simulations unveil a significant probe particle relaxation towards local minima of the interaction potential. This effect is responsible for the sharp submolecular resolution observed in AFM/STM experiments. In addition, we demonstrate that sharp apparent intermolecular bonds should not be interpreted as true hydrogen bonds, in the sense of representing areas of increased electron density. Instead, they represent the ridge between two minima of the potential energy landscape due to neighboring atoms.},

abstract  ={The new class of ESIPT-capable molecules, benzo[a]imidazo[5,1,2-cd]indolizines, bearing the 2-hydroxyphenyl substituent were prepared in a straightforward manner from imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines via a tandem [8+2]cycloaddition–[2+6+2]dehydrogenation reaction. The relationship between the structure and photophysical properties was thoroughly elucidated by comparison with simple analogues i.e. 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines. Compared with parent 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines the new chromophores strongly absorb blue light and emit in the yellow part of the spectrum. In contrast to 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, emission of π-expanded dyes in protic solvents is usually weaker than in aprotic ones, where they exhibit large Stokes shifts (5500–7000 cm−1). Unlike in solution, in the solid state luminescence for benzo[a]imidazo[5,1,2-cd]indolizines is shifted on average by 100 nm relative to the fluorescence of the corresponding imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines, which results in a relatively strong ($\Phi$fl = 0.18 to 0.27) emission of the red light. Benzo[a]imidazo[5,1,2-cd]indolizines possessing a methoxy substituent have much higher fluorescence quantum yields than analogues bearing fluorine and methyl substituents.}
